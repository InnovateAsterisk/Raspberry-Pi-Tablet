## Project Goals
To develop a 3D printable, Raspberry Pi based tablet. All parts (components) must be easy to obtain and readily available. It must have a battery, and it must be the primary source of power (meaning, it will charge up with a cable plugged in, but must have enough power to run without it.) It must be able to opperate perfect fine without a keyboard (meaning, everything in the user interface should work without an issue even if you dont have a keyboard and mouse plugged in.)

## Features
- **SBC :** Raspberry Pi version 4B+
- **Display :** 7 inch LCD Display (with touch)
- **Power Supply :** PiJuice UPS (with 5000 mAmp battery)
- **Camera :** Official Raspberry Pi 1080p Camera (front-facing)
- **Sound & Speakers:** Waveshare Audio HAT - powers 2 speakers, and 2 microphones, and provides an audio jack for headphones.
- **Accelerometer:** MPU-6050 Gyro/Accelerometer - to orientate the screen. (with python)
- **Cooling:** Fan connected to a Mosfet fan-speed controller (speed is controlled in python)
- **USB:** Breakout USB
- **Buttons:**
  - Power Button
  - Volume Up/Down rocker
- **LEDs**
  - Charge
  - Power and activity LED light is redirected (using nylon) to the case.
- **Backplate:** Bamboo wood back, with laser etched decal
